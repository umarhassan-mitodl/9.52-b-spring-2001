## Evolutionary Psychology

[Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer](http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html). Leda Cosmides & John Tooby, Department of Anthropology, University of California Santa Barbara.

[The Evolutionary Psychology FAQ](http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/evpsychfaq.html). This FAQ is written and maintained by Edward Hagen, formerly of the Center for Evolutionary Psychology, University of California, Santa Barbara, and now at the Institute for Theoretical Biology in Berlin. The FAQ assumes a basic knowledge of genes and natural selection. Its purpose is to outline the "meta-theoretical" foundations of evolutionary psychology. That is, it aims to explain the framework within which hypotheses about evolved psychological function should be formulated.
